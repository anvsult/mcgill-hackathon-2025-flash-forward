# ⚡ FlashForward

### A Chrome Extension to turn procrastination into productivity.

---

## 🧠 Inspiration
As students, our team noticed how easy it is to fall into the trap of **mindless scrolling**—especially when facing boring or difficult study tasks. We wanted to create a solution that interrupts procrastination and redirects focus back to learning. That’s how **FlashForward** was born.

---

## 🚀 What It Does
FlashForward is a **Chrome Extension** that helps users **study while managing distractions**:
- Users upload their **course notes**, which are automatically converted into **flashcards**.  
- Users can set **time limits** on specific websites (like YouTube, TikTok, or Reddit).  
- Once a limit is exceeded, the extension **locks the site** until the user correctly answers **three flashcard questions**.  

This approach turns wasted scrolling time into active recall study sessions.

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- **Backend:** Python (Flask) API for flashcard generation  
- **AI Integration:** [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) to generate question-answer flashcards from uploaded notes  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Chrome extension interface  
- **Design:** Canva for mockups and UX visualization  

---

## 🧩 Challenges We Faced
- Integrating the **Gemini API** smoothly with our Chrome Extension.  
- Managing asynchronous communication between the **frontend extension** and **Flask backend**.  
- Delivering a polished prototype within **limited hackathon time**.

---

## 💡 What We Learned
- How to **problem-solve under pressure**.  
- How to **collaborate effectively** as a cross-functional team.  
- The importance of **balancing innovation and simplicity** in a short sprint.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next
- Improve the **UI/UX** of the extension.  
- Add **multiple-choice flashcards** for more varied testing.  
- Extend the platform to **mobile devices**, targeting the biggest distraction source—phones.
